## Project title
Using YOLO object detector to detect objects in videos and images.

## Motivation
My friend and I wanted to be able to count the number of vehicles on the road real time, either using a live stream video or snapping images using a Raspberry pi.

The purpose of this repo is to share our experiences and hopefully make it a little easier for anyone who wants to explore object detection as well as working with hardwares.

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
